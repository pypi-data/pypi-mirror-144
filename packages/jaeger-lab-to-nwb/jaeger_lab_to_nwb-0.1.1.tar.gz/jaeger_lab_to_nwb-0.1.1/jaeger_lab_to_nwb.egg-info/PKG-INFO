# Install

Create a separate environment:
```bash
$ conda create -n env_jaeger python=3.7 pip
```

Activate environment and install dependencies
```bash
$ conda activate env_jaeger
$ pip install jaeger-lab-to-nwb
```

# Use

**1. Imported and run from a python script:** <br/>
Examples for each experiment can be found [here](https://github.com/catalystneuro/jaeger-lab-to-nwb/tree/master/tutorials)


**2. Graphical User Interface:** <br/>
To use the GUI, first install [nwb-web-gui](https://github.com/catalystneuro/nwb-web-gui):
```shell
$ pip install nwb-web-gui
```

The GUI can be run from the terminal:
```shell
$ nwbgui-jaeger [experiment_name]
```
Current options for experiment names are: `fret`, `labview`, `treadmill` and `bpod`. The NWB Web GUI should open in your browser. If it does not open automatically (and no error messages were printed in your terminal), just open your browser and navigate to `localhost:5000`.

The GUI eases the task of editing the metadata of the resulting `nwb` file, it is integrated with the conversion module (conversion on-click) and allows for quick visual exploration the data in the end file with [nwb-jupyter-widgets](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwb-jupyter-widgets).
