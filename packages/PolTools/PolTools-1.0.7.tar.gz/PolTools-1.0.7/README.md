PolTools is a collection of bioinformatic programs analyzing PRO-Seq, PRO-Cap, and similar next generation sequencing experiments analyzing nascent RNAs.

It is primary written in python3, but utilizes R for plotting and C++ for computationally expensive analyses. These tools were developed in the Price Lab.

Please see the [documentation](https://geoffscollins.github.io/PolTools/index.html) for more information. 

PolTools contains 19 main programs, listed below. However, PolTools is much more than a collection of bioinformatic programs. It contains an extensive library of utility functions which can easily be used to create new, exciting bioinformatic tools.
