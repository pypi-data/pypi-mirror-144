## Hacking

If you want to edit the source code:
- Clone the repository

- Create a virtual environment
```        
    python3 -m venv venv/
```

- Activate the virtual environment
  - For Linux
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
  - For Windows CMD
  ```
  cd venv/Scripts
  activate
  ```

- Upgrade the Pip version <**very important**>
```        
    pip install -U pip
```

- Install the package in editable mode `-e/--editable`
with the "dev" extra included
```        
    pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

This installs `pynation` from the source directory and changes
will be immediately reflected. It also installs extra development tools such as `pytest`
