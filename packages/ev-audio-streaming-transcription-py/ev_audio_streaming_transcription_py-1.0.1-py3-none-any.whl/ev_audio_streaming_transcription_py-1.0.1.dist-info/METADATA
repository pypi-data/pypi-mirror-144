# Engage Voice Audio Streaming Quick Test Package

This package is to test basic functionality of Engage Voice Audio Streaming feature by using [Google Cloud Speech-To-Text Service](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text)

## Getting Started

### 1. Enable Google Cloud Speech-To-Text Service

- [Google Cloud Account](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [Enable Google Speech To Text Service](https://console.cloud.google.com/speech/overview)
- [Google Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started)

After above steps, you will get a JSON key file in your local drive. Create a new environment variable with name as 'GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS' and value as your file path(including file name).

### 2. Install This Package

1. Create a new folder and do:

`pip install`

1. Create a new file `server.py` with code below in it:

```
from ev_audio_streaming_transcription_py import server
import asyncio

port=3333
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    asyncio.run(server.main(port))
```

3. Run the script
4. Install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or other similar web tunneling tool, and run:

`ngrok http 3333`

You'll get a HTTPS address. Replace 'HTTPS' with 'WSS' and that is the address to be uploaded to your streaming profile.
