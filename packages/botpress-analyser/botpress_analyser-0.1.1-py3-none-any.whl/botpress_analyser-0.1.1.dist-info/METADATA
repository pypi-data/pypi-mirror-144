# NLP Analyser tool

This tool provide a small GUI to cluster a corpus

For now it support only csv files and txt files.

# Using the GUI

We provide a small gui to help less technical users.
## Launching the gui
Once installed, run `nlp_analyser gui` to launch the app. 

It will launch on localhost, port 8501 by default.

You can then go to http://localhost:8501 and use the tool.

## Using a csv file
We provide a small utility to convert a csv file to a txt one. 

You __need__ to provide the column index where the text is and the csv delimiter.

By default it's `0` and `,` 

Then you can import any csv file, right after importing, a button will appear in the sidebar and you will be able to download the converted txt file.

Then the tool will automatically use this new converted text file as if you exported that in the first time.
## Using a txt file

You have nothing to do when using a text file. 
Just ensure that it's one sentence per line.

Buttons will appear and you will be able to analyse and cluster your corpus

# Analysis
When analyzing the corpus, we provide a progress bar. However, the operation might be really slow on big corpuses....

When clustering, we have no way to report progress but that can also be long for huge files...


# Using the cli 

We also provide a cli for users that prefer to use the command line.

After installing you can access it with `nlp_analyser --help` and follow from there.

It provide the same command as the gui : converting a csv and analyzing the corpus.
