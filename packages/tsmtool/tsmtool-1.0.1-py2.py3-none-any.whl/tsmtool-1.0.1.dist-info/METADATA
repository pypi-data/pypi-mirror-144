Tarsnap Status Monitor

The most excellent tarsnap.com has a clean and functional interface for managing one's account.  This tool connects to the
web interface and queries data, producing a JSON-formated report.  The current balance is read, and an estimated monthly
cost is calculated based on the site's daily cost data.

Here's an example of output from the author's account:
```
(tsmtool) mkrueger@beaker:~/src/tsmtool$ tsmtool rstms
{
  "balance": 32.51,
  "account": "mkrueger@rstms.net",
  "monthly_cost": 23.51
}
```

A config file may be used for account data, or the email account / password may be passed as command line options.
The config file is a whitespace delimited text file with one line per account.
Each line has these fields:

`~/.tsmtool`: 
```
ACCOUNT_NAME    EMAIL_ADDRESS   PASSWORD
```
