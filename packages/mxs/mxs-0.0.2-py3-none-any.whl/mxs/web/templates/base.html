<!doctype html>
{#
  There are three blocks defined here that will be overridden in the other templates:

      {% block title %} will change the title displayed in the browserâ€™s tab and window title.

      {% block header %} is similar to title but will change the title displayed on the page.

      {% block content %} is where the content of each page goes, such as the login form or a blog post.

  The base template is directly in the templates directory. To keep the others organized, the templates for a blueprint will be placed in a directory with the same name as the blueprint.

  g is automatically available in templates. Based on if g.user is set (from load_logged_in_user), either the username and a log out link are displayed, or links to register and log in are displayed. url_for() is also automatically available, and is used to generate URLs to views instead of writing them out manually.
