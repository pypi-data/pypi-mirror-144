        It is common for the model to have components whose parameters are all fixed, and thus the way that component

        parameters chosen by the non-linear search.

        Preloading exploits this to speed up the log likelihood function, by inspecting the model and storing in memory
        quantities that do not change. For the example above, the image of all galaxies would be stored in memory and
