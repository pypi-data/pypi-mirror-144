                hour, `'1d'` for one day, and `'1w'` for 1 week.
            start: Starting datetime of the data to be fetched.
                The input argument can be a string indicating a
                valid datetime-like string or a number indicating the
                timestamp in milliseconds.

            pbar: Optional `ProgBar` instance input. Used for combining
                multiple calls of `get_ohlcv()`.

            OHLCVFetchError: Raised for any errors that causes the

        Returns:
            A list of list representing the candlestick data fetched
            from the exchange. Each row/inner list contains six

        Since we want the user to be able to readily use
        the `get_ohlcv()` without thinking much about this small detail,
        we automatically fill up the starting and end timestamps
        based on the parameters provided. Here are the different
        fill up cases:

        * If `start` and `end` are not provided, `end` is assigned the
          latest date and `start` is `end` minus the limit of one fetch
          based on the indicated exchange.
        * If either `start` and `end` are not provided but the other one
          is, we just add or subtract the same fetch limit to compute
          for `end` or `start`.
        * Lastly, if both are provided by the user, we use those without
          any other processing.

        Arguments:
            start: Starting datetime of the data to be fetched.
                The input argument can be a string indicating a
                valid datetime-like string or a number indicating the
                timestamp in milliseconds.
            end: Ending timestamp of the data to be fetched.
                The input argument can be a string indicating a
                valid datetime-like string or a number indicating the
                timestamp in milliseconds.
            timeframe: Timeframe of the candlestick data to fetch. Some
                examples of valid timeframe strings are `'2h'` for two
                hour, `'1d'` for one day, and `'1w'` for 1 week.
            include_latest: If the `include_latest` variable is set to
                `True`, the latest OHLCV data is not returned since it
                is not finished yet. If set to `False`, then the
                unfinished data at the time `get_ohlcv()` was called
                will be returned.
