This package amplifies this language by adding an API for creating fluent expressions loosely based off of the `pandas` syntax. These expressions are use for simplifying large bits of scoreboard and storage operation allowing you to swiftly create complex operations with the ease of normal programming.\n\n```py\nfrom bolt_expressions import Scoreboard\n\nObjective = ctx.inject(Scoreboard)\nmath = Objective("math")\n\nmath["@s"] = math["@r"] * 10 + math["@r"] + 100\n```\n->\n```mcfunction\nscoreboard players operations $i0 bolt.expressions.temp = @r math\nscoreboard players operations $i0 bolt.expressions.temp *= #10 bolt.expressions.int\nscoreboard players operations $i1 bolt.expressions.temp = @r math\nscoreboard players add $i1 bolt.expressions.temp 100\nscoreboard players operations $i0 bolt.expressions.temp += $i1 bolt.expressions.temp\nscoreboard players operations @s math = $i0 bolt.expressions.temp\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nThe package can be installed with `pip`. Note, you must have both `beet` and `mecha` installed to use this package.\n\n```bash\n$ pip install bolt-expressions\n```\n\n## Getting started\n\nThis package is designed to be used within any `bolt` script (either a `.mcfunction` or `bolt` file) inside a `mecha.contrib.bolt` enabled project. Note, `bolt-expressions` is not a plugin (yet), so there\'s no need to `require` `bolt-expressions`.\n\n```yaml\nrequire:\n    - mecha.contrib.bolt\n\npipeline:\n    - mecha\n```\n\nOnce you\'ve enabled bolt, you are able to import the python package directly inside your bolt script.\n\n```py\nfrom bolt_expressions import Scoreboard, Storage\n```\n\nAny usage of the `bolt_expressions` package will require you to inject the current beet context into the API objects. Then, you can create an objective and start creating expressions.\n\n```py\nObjective = ctx.inject(Scoreboard)\n\nmath = Objective("math")\nentity_id = Objective("entity_id")\n\nmath["@s"] += 10\n```\n\n## Features\n\nThe `Scoreboard` object provides a rich API for you to interact within your bolt landscape. Most numerical operations (such as `+`, `*`, `%`) will produce correct `scoreboard operation` commands for you to work with.\n\n```\nCONSTANT = 60 * 60 * 24\nmath["@s"] *= (entity_id["current_id"] / 200) + CONSTANT\n```\n\nYou can also utilize local variables to simplify readability with longer operations. This is due to the unique `__rebind__` operator provided only in the `bolt` context which allows us provide custom behavior with the `=` operation. We also have defined helper functions such as `min` and `max`, alongside `sqrt` and `**` (for `pow`).\n\n```py\ndmg_obj = Objective("damage")\ndamage = dmg_obj["damage"]\ntoughness = dmg_obj["toughness"]\narmor = dmg_obj["armor"]\n\natf = (10 * armor - (400 * damage / (80 + 10 * toughness)))  # local variable\nmaxxed = max((10 * armor) / 5, atf)                          # still local variable\ndamage = damage * (250 - (min(200, maxxed))) / 25            # calls __rebind__!\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome. Make sure to first open an issue discussing the problem or the new feature before creating a pull request. The project uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org).\n\n```bash\n$ poetry install\n```\n\nYou can run the tests with `poetry run pytest`.\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run pytest\n```\n\nThe project must type-check with [`pyright`](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright). If you\'re using VSCode the [`pylance`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) extension should report diagnostics automatically. You can also install the type-checker locally with `npm install` and run it from the command-line.\n\n```bash\n$ npm run watch\n$ npm run check\n```\n\nThe code follows the [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) code style. Import statements are sorted with [`isort`](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/).\n\n```bash\n$ poetry run isort bolt_expressions examples tests\n$ poetry run black bolt_expressions examples tests\n$ poetry run black --check bolt_expressions examples tests\n```\n\n---\n\nLicense - [MIT](https://github.com/rx-modules/bolt-expressions/blob/main/LICENSE)\n',
