# Piped API client (Python)

[![Test with pyTest](https://github.com/CWKevo/python-piped-api-client/actions/workflows/pytest.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/CWKevo/python-piped-api-client/actions/workflows/pytest.yml)

A Python API wrapper for [Piped](https://piped-docs.kavin.rocks/). This can essentially be used as an alternative way to access YouTube's API, without needing to use an API key.

## Installation

```bash
pip install piped-api
```

## Quickstart

Getting started is very easy:

```python
from piped_api import PipedClient

CLIENT = PipedClient()


# Print out the first audio stream URL for a video:
video = CLIENT.get_video(video_id)
audio_stream = video.get_streams('audio')[0]

print(f"Audio stream URL: {audio_stream.url} ({audio_stream.mime_type})")
```

You can find more examples in the [`tests`](https://github.com/CWKevo/python-piped-api-client/tree/master/tests) folder.

## Why?

<!-- Soon... maybe.

This package has allowed me to start creating my open-source project, [ArchiveTube](https://github.com/CWKevo/ArchiveTube) - a scrapper and archive for YouTube content (videos and comments) - to preserve them and make them available to anyone, with ability to search for comments and videos. View hall of fame (most liked comments and videos), bring back dislikes via [ReturnYouTubeDislike.com](https://returnyoutubedislike.com), view deleted content and much more!
Google has showed us that they make YouTube own us by harvesting our data. This is also followed by non-throught out decisions, which their users aren't happy with. Let's do it the other way around this time by reclaiming our content and entertainment back & make YouTube great again!
-->

The creation of this package was primarily fueled by the same type of motivation [Piped has](https://piped-docs.kavin.rocks/docs/why/).

Google's API is not very easy-to-use - you must obtain some JSON thingy to use it, and it is very low-level and not very user-friendly.
On the other hand, this package accessed the [Piped API](https://piped.kavin.rocks/), which has a much more high-level API and doesn't need an account or API keys.

It is not meant to be a replacement for the official YouTube API, but it can help you to cut the strings that Google attaches to you when using their API.
