Hypper is a data-mining Python library for binary classification. It uses hypergraph-based methods to explore datasets for the purpose of undersampling, feature selection and binary classification.

Hypper provides an easy-to-use interface familiar to well-recognized Scikit-Learn API. 

The primary goal of this library is to provide a tool for handling datasets consisting of mainly categorical features. Novel hypergraph-based methods proposed in the Hypper library were benchmarked against the alternative solutions and achieved satisfactory results. More details can be found in scientific papers presented in the section below.
