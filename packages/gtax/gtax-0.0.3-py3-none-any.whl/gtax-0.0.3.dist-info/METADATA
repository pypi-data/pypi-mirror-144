GTax
====

**GTax** python package provides tools for the creation of the GTax sequence-based database. This database includes
one assembly per organism deposited in the NCBI Genomes database. The sequences are organized by 17 taxonomic levels
from *superkindom* to *clades*. Python pickle files are also provided with a graph data structure for the taxonomic 
tree.
