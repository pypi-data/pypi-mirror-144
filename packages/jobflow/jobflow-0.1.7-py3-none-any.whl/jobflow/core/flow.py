    A Flow contains a collection of Jobs or other Flows to execute.

    The :obj:`Flow` object is the main tool for constructing workflows. Flows
    can either contain Jobs or other Flows. Like :obj:`.Job` objects, Flow objects
    can also have outputs, however, these are not explicitly stored in the database.
    Instead, the outputs of a Flow act to structure the outputs of the jobs
    contained within the Flow.

    Parameters
    ----------
    jobs
        The jobs to be run as a list of :obj:`.Job` or :obj:`Flow` objects.
    output
        The output of the flow. These should come from the output of one or more
        of the jobs.
    name
        The flow name.
    order
        The order in which the jobs should be exectuted. The default is to determine
        the order automatically based on the connections between jobs.
    uuid
        The identifier of the flow. This is genenrated automatically.
    host
        The identifier of the host flow. This is set automatically when an flow
        is included in the jobs array of another flow.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a job in the ``jobs`` array is already part of another flow.
    ValueError
        If any jobs needed to resolve the inputs of all jobs in the ``jobs`` array are
        missing.
    ValueError
        If any jobs needed to resolve the flow ``output`` are missing.

    Warns
    -----
    UserWarning
        If a ``.Job`` or ``Flow`` object is used as the Flow ``output`` rather
        than an ``OutputReference``.

    See Also
    --------
    .job, .Job, JobOrder

    Examples
    --------
    Below we define a simple job to add two numbers, and create an flow containing
    two connected add jobs.

    >>> from jobflow import job, Flow
    >>> @job
    ... def add(a, b):
    ...     return a + b
    >>> add_first = add(1, 2)
    >>> add_second = add(add_first.output, 2)
    >>> flow = Flow(jobs=[add_first, add_second])

    This flow does not expose any of the outputs of the jobs contained within it.
    We could instead "register" the output of the second add as the output of the
    flow.

    >>> flow = Flow(jobs=[add_first, add_second], output=add_second.output)

    This will allow the flow to be used in another flow. In this way, Flows
    can be infinitely nested. For example:

    >>> add_third = add(flow.output, 5)
    >>> outer_flow = Flow(jobs=[flow, add_third])

    Flows can be run using an flow manager. These enable running Flows
    locally or on compute clusters (using the FireWorks manager).

    >>> from jobflow.managers.local import run_locally
    >>> response = run_locally(flow)

        >>> flow.update_kwargs({"number": 10}, function_filter=add)

        nested
            Whether to apply the updates to Maker objects that are themselves kwargs
            of Maker, job, or flow objects. See examples for more details.
        dict_mod
            Use the dict mod language to apply updates. See :obj:`.DictMods` for more
            details.

        Examples
        --------
        Consider the following flow containing jobs from a Maker:

        >>> from dataclasses import dataclass
        >>> from jobflow import job, Maker, Flow
        >>> @dataclass
        ... class AddMaker(Maker):
        ...     name: str = "add"
        ...     number: float = 10

        ...     def make(self, a):
        ...         return a + self.number
        >>> maker = AddMaker()
        >>> add_job = maker.make(1)
        >>> flow = Flow([add_job])

        The ``number`` argument could be updated in the following ways.

        >>> flow.update_maker_kwargs({"number": 10})

        This will work if all Makers in the flow have a kwarg called number.
        However, when this is not the case this will result in the bad input kwargs
        for some Makers. To only apply the update to the correct Makers, filters can be
        used.

        >>> flow.update_maker_kwargs({"number": 10}, name_filder="add")
        >>> flow.update_maker_kwargs({"number": 10}, class_filter=AddMaker)

        By default, the updates are applied to nested Makers. These are Makers
        which are present in the kwargs of another Maker. Consider the following case
        for a Maker that produces a job that restarts.

        >>> from jobflow import Response
        >>> @dataclass
        ... class RestartMaker(Maker):
        ...     name: str = "replace"
        ...     add_maker: Maker = AddMaker()
        ...
        ...     @job
        ...     def make(self, a):
        ...         restart_job = self.add_maker.make(a)
        ...         return Response(replace=restart_job)
        >>> maker = RestartMaker()
        >>> my_job = maker.make(1)
        >>> flow = Flow([my_job]

        The following update will apply to the nested ``AddMaker`` in the kwargs of the
        ``RestartMaker``:

        >>> flow.update_maker_kwargs({"number": 10}, class_filter=AddMaker)

        However, if ``nested=False``, then the update will not be applied to the nested
        Maker:

        >>> flow.update_maker_kwargs(
        ...     {"number": 10}, class_filter=AddMaker, nested=False
