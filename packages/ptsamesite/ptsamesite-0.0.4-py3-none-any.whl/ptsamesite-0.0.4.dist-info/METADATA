# PTSAMESITE
> Same Site Scripting Testing Tool

ptsamesite is a tool for testing Same Site Scripting vulnerability. ptsamesite supports mass domain testing.

- Script sends DNS "A" query to domain with 'localhost' as subdomain.
- If DNS responds with IP '127.0.0.1', the record is prone to Same Site Scripting vulnerability. 

## Installation

```
pip install ptsamesite
```

## Add to PATH
If you cannot invoke the script in your terminal, its probably because its not in your PATH. Fix it by running commands below.
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage examples
```
$ ptsamesite -d example.com
$ ptsamesite -d subdomain1.subdomain2.example.com -s
$ ptsamesite -d example.com example2.com
$ ptsamesite -f domain_list.txt
```

```
-d  --domain      <domain>   Test domain
-f  --file        <file>     Test domains from file
-V  --vulnerable             Print only vulnerable domains
-s  --subdomains             Scan all subdomains of given domain
