It also contains a lot of samples to learn how to use it.\n\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/babylonjs.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/babylonjs)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js)\n[![Average time to resolve an issue](http://isitmaintained.com/badge/resolution/BabylonJS/Babylon.js.svg)](http://isitmaintained.com/project/BabylonJS/Babylon.js \"Average time to resolve an issue\")\n[![Percentage of issues still open](https://isitmaintained.com/badge/open/babylonJS/babylon.js.svg)](https://isitmaintained.com/project/babylonJS/babylon.js \"Percentage of issues still open\")\n[![Build Size](https://img.badgesize.io/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/master/dist/preview%20release/babylon.js.svg?compression=gzip)](https://img.badgesize.io/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/master/dist/preview%20release/babylon.js.svg?compression=gzip)\n[![Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/babylonjs.svg?style=social&label=Follow)](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=babylonjs)\n\n**Any questions?** Here is our official [forum](https://forum.babylonjs.com/).\n\n## CDN\n\nTo look into our CDN bundled distribution, you can refer to the package [babylonjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babylonjs)\n\n## npm\n\nBabylonJS and its modules are published on npm as esNext modules with full typing support. To install, use:\n\n```text\nnpm install @babylonjs/core --save\n```\n\nThis will allow you to import BabylonJS entirely using:\n\n```javascript\nimport * as BABYLON from '@babylonjs/core/Legacy/legacy';\n```\n\nor individual classes to benefit from enhanced tree shaking using :\n\n```javascript\nimport { Scene } from '@babylonjs/core/scene';\nimport { Engine } from '@babylonjs/core/Engines/engine';\n```\n\nTo add a module, install the respective package. A list of extra packages and their installation instructions can be found on the [babylonjs user on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~babylonjs) scoped on @babylonjs.\n\n## Usage\n\nSee [our ES6 dedicated documentation](https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/es6_support):\n\n```javascript\nimport { Engine } from \"@babylonjs/core/Engines/engine\";\nimport { Scene } from \"@babylonjs/core/scene\";\nimport { Vector3 } from \"@babylonjs/core/Maths/math\";\nimport { FreeCamera } from \"@babylonjs/core/Cameras/freeCamera\";\nimport { HemisphericLight } from \"@babylonjs/core/Lights/hemisphericLight\";\nimport { Mesh } from \"@babylonjs/core/Meshes/mesh\";\n\n// Side-effects only imports allowing the standard material to be used as default.\nimport \"@babylonjs/core/Materials/standardMaterial\";\n// Side-effects only imports allowing Mesh to create default shapes (to enhance tree shaking, the construction methods on mesh are not available if the meshbuilder has not been imported).\nimport \"@babylonjs/core/Meshes/Builders/sphereBuilder\";\nimport \"@babylonjs/core/Meshes/Builders/boxBuilder\";\nimport \"@babylonjs/core/Meshes/Builders/groundBuilder\";\n\nconst canvas = document.getElementById(\"renderCanvas\") as HTMLCanvasElement;\nconst engine = new Engine(canvas);\nvar scene = new Scene(engine);\n\n// This creates and positions a free camera (non-mesh)\nvar camera = new FreeCamera(\"camera1\", new Vector3(0, 5, -10), scene);\n\n// This targets the camera to scene origin\ncamera.setTarget(Vector3.Zero());\n\n// This attaches the camera to the canvas\ncamera.attachControl(canvas, true);\n\n// This creates a light, aiming 0,1,0 - to the sky (non-mesh)\nvar light = new HemisphericLight(\"light1\", new Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);\n\n// Default intensity is 1. Let's dim the light a small amount\nlight.intensity = 0.7;\n\n// Our built-in 'sphere' shape. Params: name, subdivs, size, scene\nvar sphere = Mesh.CreateSphere(\"sphere1\", 16, 2, scene);\n\n// Move the sphere upward 1/2 its height\nsphere.position.y = 2;\n\n// Our built-in 'ground' shape. Params: name, width, depth, subdivs, scene\nMesh.CreateGround(\"ground1\", 6, 6, 2, scene);\n\nengine.runRenderLoop(() => {\n    scene.render();\n});\n```\n\n## Preview release\n\nPreview version of **4.0** can be found [here](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/tree/master/dist/preview%20release).\nIf you want to contribute, please read our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/contributing.md) first.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Documentation](https://doc.babylonjs.com)\n- [Examples](https://doc.babylonjs.com/examples)\n\n## Contributing\nPlease see the [Contributing Guidelines](./contributing.md)\n\n## Useful links\n\n- Official web site: [www.babylonjs.com](https://www.babylonjs.com/)\n- Online [playground](https://playground.babylonjs.com/) to learn by experimentating\n- Online [sandbox](https://www.babylonjs.com/sandbox) where you can test your .babylon and glTF scenes with a simple drag'n'drop\n- Online [shader creation tool](https://www.babylonjs.com/cyos/) where you can learn how to create GLSL shaders\n- 3DS Max [exporter](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Exporters/tree/master/3ds%20Max) can be used to generate a .babylon file from 3DS Max\n- Maya [exporter](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Exporters/tree/master/Maya) can be used to generate a .babylon file from 3DS Max\n- Blender [exporter](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Exporters/tree/master/Blender) can be used to generate a .babylon file from Blender 3d\n- Unity 5[ (deprecated) exporter](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Exporters/tree/master/Unity) can be used to export your geometries from Unity 5 scene editor(animations are supported)\n- [glTF Tools](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF#gltf-tools) by KhronosGroup\n\n## Features\n\nTo get a complete list of supported features, please visit our [website](https://www.babylonjs.com/#specifications).\n\n## Build\n\nBabylon.js is automatically built using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/).
