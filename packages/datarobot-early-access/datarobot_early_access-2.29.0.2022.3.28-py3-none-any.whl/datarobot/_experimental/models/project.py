        If the project is not datetime partitioned, an error will occur.

        All durations should be specified with a duration string such as those returned
        by the :meth:`partitioning_methods.construct_duration_string
        <datarobot.helpers.partitioning_methods.construct_duration_string>` helper method.

        for more information on duration strings.

        Parameters
        ----------
        blueprint_id : str
            the blueprint to use to train the model
        featurelist_id : str, optional
            the featurelist to use to train the model.  If not specified, the project default will
            be used.
        training_row_count : int, optional
            the number of rows of data that should be used to train the model.  If specified,
            neither ``training_duration`` nor ``use_project_settings`` may be specified.
        training_duration : str, optional
            a duration string specifying what time range the data used to train the model should
            span.  If specified, neither ``training_row_count`` nor ``use_project_settings`` may be
            specified.
        sampling_method : str, optional
            (New in version v2.23) defines the way training data is selected. Can be either
            ``random`` or ``latest``.  In combination with ``training_row_count`` defines how rows
            are selected from backtest (``latest`` by default).  When training data is defined using
            time range (``training_duration`` or ``use_project_settings``) this setting changes the
            way ``time_window_sample_pct`` is applied (``random`` by default).  Applicable to OTV
            projects only.
        use_project_settings : bool, optional
            (New in version v2.20) defaults to ``False``. If ``True``, indicates that the custom
            backtest partitioning settings specified by the user will be used to train the model and
            evaluate backtest scores. If specified, neither ``training_row_count`` nor
            ``training_duration`` may be specified.
        source_project_id : str, optional
            the id of the project this blueprint comes from, if not this project.  If left
            unspecified, the blueprint must belong to this project.
        monotonic_increasing_featurelist_id : str, optional
            (New in version v2.18) optional, the id of the featurelist that defines
            the set of features with a monotonically increasing relationship to the target.
            Passing ``None`` disables increasing monotonicity constraint. Default
            (``dr.enums.MONOTONICITY_FEATURELIST_DEFAULT``) is the one specified by the blueprint.
        monotonic_decreasing_featurelist_id : str, optional
            (New in version v2.18) optional, the id of the featurelist that defines
            the set of features with a monotonically decreasing relationship to the target.
            Passing ``None`` disables decreasing monotonicity constraint. Default
            (``dr.enums.MONOTONICITY_FEATURELIST_DEFAULT``) is the one specified by the blueprint.
        n_clusters : int, optional
            optional, The number of clusters to use in the specified unsupervised clustering model.
            ONLY VALID IN UNSUPERVISED CLUSTERING PROJECTS
