	WATTS (Workflow and Template Toolkit for Simulation) provides a set of
	Python classes that can manage simulation workflows for multiple codes where
	information is exchanged at a coarse level. For each code, input files rely
	on placeholder values that are filled in based on a set of user-defined
	parameters.
	
	WATTS is being developed with support from Argonne National Laboratory. For
	any questions, please contact [watts@anl.gov](mailto:watts@anl.gov).
