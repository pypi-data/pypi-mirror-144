Simply run\n```sh\npip install combpyter\n```\nto install the library.\n\n\n## Features\n\nPlease note that this is a personal and mostly research-driven project.\nAs such, the implemented combinatorial structures span, for the time being,\na narrow scope.\n\nCurrently, `combpyter` supports the following combinatorial objects:\n\n- Dyck paths (elements: `DyckPath`, generator: `DyckPaths`)\n\n\n## Example usage\n\nThis snippet iterates over all Dyck paths of semi-length 8 and computes\nthe distribution of the number of peaks (which is a statistic described\nby [Narayana numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narayana_number)).\n\n```python\n>>> from combpyter import DyckPaths\n>>> from collections import defaultdict\n>>> peak_distribution = defaultdict(int)\n>>> for path in DyckPaths(8):\n...     num_peaks = len(path.peaks())\n...     peak_distribution[num_peaks] += 1\n...\n>>> for num_peaks, num_paths in peak_distribution.items():\n...     print(f"There are {num_paths} Dyck paths with {num_peaks} peaks.")\n...\nThere are 1 Dyck paths with 1 peaks.\nThere are 28 Dyck paths with 2 peaks.\nThere are 196 Dyck paths with 3 peaks.\nThere are 490 Dyck paths with 4 peaks.\nThere are 490 Dyck paths with 5 peaks.\nThere are 196 Dyck paths with 6 peaks.\nThere are 28 Dyck paths with 7 peaks.\nThere are 1 Dyck paths with 8 peaks.\n```\n',
