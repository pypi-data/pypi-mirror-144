# Gestor de consultas para selección de perfiles AISC

La AISC (American Institute of Steel Construction) es el Instituto Americano de la Construcción en Acero.

AISCPy establece una base de datos y funciones para consultar el mismo, de manera que con esta se pueda desarrollar aplicaciones de calculo estructural en acero. 

Propiedades de los perfiles y unidades:
