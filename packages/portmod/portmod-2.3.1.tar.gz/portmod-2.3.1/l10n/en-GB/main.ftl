## Help Message Strings
description = CLI Package manager designed for packaging game mods
# $command (String) - Name of the command
invalid-cli-help = Invalid command line options were passed to `portmod`.

merge-help = Install or remove packages

# Note: this must be in ReStucturedText format to display properly in the doc.
merge-desc = {merge-help}

    Packages passed as arguments will always be installed (or re-installed) unless the ``--update`` flag is used, and will be selected (tracked as explicitly installed and not removed unless explicitly removed) unless the ``--oneshot`` flag is used.

    Package changes are displayed using a transaction list of the following form::

        {"[XX]"} category/package-name USE="flag -disabled-flag"

    X is a placeholder for one of the following:
        - f   fetch-restricted, but already available in the download cache
        - F   fetch-restricted, but unavailable in the download cache (must be downloaded manually)
        - N   (new) indicates the package was not previously installed
        - R   (reinstall) indicates that the same version of the package is being re-installed.
        - U   (update) indicates that the package is being updated to new version
        - D   (downgrade) indicates that the package is being downgraded to an older version
        - d   (delete) indicates that the package is being removed

    USE flags:
        - Enabled flags are displayed bold red.
        - Disabled flags are displayed blue.
        - Flags which have changed since the last time the package was installed are displayed bold green.
        - Flags in use expand categories are displayed in the form CATEGORY="flag" (for the flag 'category_flag')

repo-remove-help = Remove a package repository from this prefix
repo-does-not-exist = Repository { $name } does not exist
repo-adding = Adding repository { $name } to { $conf }
repo-removing = Removing repository { $name } from { $conf }
repos-available = Available Repositories
repo-placeholder = REPO
repo-identifier-help = Identifier for the repository. Either the repository name, or its index in the list.

## Init Messages

init-help = Create a new prefix
# Placeholder for use in commands that accept a prefix name as an argument
prefix-placeholder = PREFIX
init-prefix-help = Prefix name which will be used in commands that interact with the prefix
init-arch-help = Game engine Architecture of the prefix
# $local (String) the directory where portmod stores prefixes. E.g. ~/.local/share/portmod on Linux.
init-directory-help = Directory in which to create the prefix. If omitted, portmod will create the prefix within a new directory in { $local }.

    If files already exist in the directory, they will be left alone to allow portmod to work with existing game data.
    Portmod may install over top of these files, however the original versions will be preserved and restored if the package overwriting those files is removed, or the prefix is removed.

unknown-arch = Architecture { $arch } could not be found. It may not be a supported Architecture.
# $prefix (String) Portmod prefix being initialized
existing-configuration = Existing configuration for prefix { $prefix } found
existing-configuration-prompt = Would you like to use this configuration?
init-preamble = Before a prefix can be used, it needs package repositories, and a configuration profile
    Portmod's only hardcoded package repository, the meta repository, serves primarily
    to introduce other repositories, so you will need to select repositories from those
    which match your architecture.
    For many architectures, there is only one such repository, in which case it will be selected automatically
    A profile provides a set of configuration options for a prefix
    Profiles are provided by repositories, so the available profiles may depend on the repositories you choose

# $repo (String)
# $arch (String)
init-single-repo = The only repository available for arch { $arch } is { $repo }. Adding...
init-repositories-prompt = Please select repositories to add
init-profile-prompt = Please select a profile
init-subcommands = To change profiles and repositories in future, the following subcommands can be used:
init-non-interactive-postamble = Running in non-interactive mode with no preexisting configuration.
    No repositories will be initialized, and the profile will need to be set manually
    To change profiles and repositories, the following subcommands can be used:
database-exists = The package database already exists at { $path } and will not be re-created

## Destroy Messages
destroy-help = Destroy this prefix
destroy-preserve-root-help = Don't remove the prefix ROOT when destroyign the prefix (removed by default)
destroy-remove-config-help = Remove the prefix config directory when destroyign the prefix (not removed by default)

destroy-directories = The following directories will be removed when the prefix is destroyed:
destroy-exclude-prompt = Please enter any directories you wish to be excluded (if any), or -1 to abort
# $prefix (String) The name of the prefix being destroyed
destroy-prompt = Are you sure you want to destroy prefix { $prefix }?
no-directories-to-remove = There are no directories which need to be removed
# $path (String) The ROOT path of the prefix
destroy-preserve-original = The files originally in { $path } will be preserved. Only files created by portmod will be removed.
    You can keep the installed data using the --preserve-root argument

## Prefix messages
# $prefix (String) - The prefix name
initialized-prefix = Initialized prefix { $prefix }
# $prefix (String) - The prefix name
prefix-help = Interact with the { $prefix } prefix
# $prefix (String) - The prefix name
prefix-exists = The prefix { $prefix } already exists
# $prefix (String) - The prefix name
invalid-prefix = The prefix { $prefix } does not exist
# $prefix (String) - The prefix name
removing-prefix = Removing prefix { $prefix } from prefix file
# $newpath (String) - The new prefix directory to be created
# $oldpath (String) - An existing prefix directory
# $prefix (String) - The existing prefix name corresponding to $oldpath
prefix-overlap = Directory { $newpath } overlaps with existing prefix { $prefix } at path { $oldpath }!
# $path (String) - The directory which cannot be written to
directory-not-writable = Directory at path { $path } cannot be written to!

## Locking Messages

acquiring-write-vdb = Waiting for write access to the package database
acquiring-read-vdb = Waiting for read access to the package database
acquiring-exclusive = Waiting for exclusive access to the portmod system

## Validate Messages
# $path (String) - The path of the installed file
installed-file-missing = Installed file at path { $path } is missing!
# $pkg (String) - The package which installed the file
installed-file-mismatch = Installed file at path { $path } does not match the file installed by package { $pkg }!
