# SimpleLogger

## Description

A simple logger I made for some projects a year ago.

## Usage

```python
from simplelogger.logger import Logger  # Import the logger.

log_obj = Logger(  # Create a logger object.
    "Test Logger",  # The name of the logger.
    "logfile.log",  # Where to write the logs.
    loglevel=5  # Set the log level. Capture all types of log.
)

log_obj.info("Sample Information message.")
log_obj.warning("Sample warning message.")
log_obj.error("Sample error message.")
log_obj.debug("Sample debug message.")
log_obj.critical("Sample critical message.")

```
