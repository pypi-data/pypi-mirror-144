What is VIP?
------------
``VIP`` stands for Vortex Image Processing. 
It is a python package for high-contrast imaging of exoplanets and circumstellar disks. 
``VIP`` is compatible with Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 (Python 2 compatibility dropped with ``VIP`` 0.9.9).

The goal of ``VIP`` is to integrate open-source, efficient, easy-to-use and
well-documented implementations of high-contrast image processing algorithms to
the interested scientific community. The main repository of ``VIP`` resides on
`GitHub <https://github.com/vortex-exoplanet/VIP>`_, the standard for scientific
open source code distribution, using Git as a version control system.

The project started as the effort of `Carlos Alberto Gomez Gonzalez <https://carlgogo.github.io/>`_,
a former PhD student of the `VORTEX team <http://www.vortex.ulg.ac.be/>`_
(ULiege, Belgium). ``VIP``'s development has first been led by Dr. Gomez with contributions
made by collaborators from several teams (take a look at the 
`contributors tab <https://github.com/vortex-exoplanet/VIP/graphs/contributors>`_ on
``VIP``'s GitHub repository). It is now maintained and developed by Dr. Valentin Christiaens.
Most of ``VIP``'s functionalities are mature but
it doesn't mean it's free from bugs. The code is continuously evolving and
therefore feedback/contributions are greatly appreciated. If you want to report
a bug or suggest a functionality please create an issue on GitHub. Pull
requests are very welcomed!
