Both king netherlands and the 1st chamber wrote back to :ref:`confirm <guilty>`
their informedness that what they call medication in their "care laws" is not
medication but :ref:`poison <evidence>`. This makes the care laws not laws
to give care to elderly, handicapped, wicked and criminals but genocide laws
where the poison makes impotent, tortures to suicide and kills members of these
groups.

``genocide`` contains :ref:`correspondence <correspondence>` with the International Criminal Court, asking for arrest of the king of the netherlands, for the genocide he is committing with his new treatement laws. Current status is an outside the jurisdiction judgement of the prosecutor which requires a reconsider to have the king actually arrested, see :ref:`here <reconsider>`.

This genocide takes place on the elderly, handicapped, wicked and criminals
instead of groups based on culture, religion or race. Since the court has 
jurisidiction over genocide if it is after 2002, it just needs an addendum to
deal with genocides that are taking place on other groups than mentioned in the
`Statute of Rome <https://www.icc-cpi.int/resource-library/documents/rs-eng.pdf>`_.
