# TODO: hdt has pybind11 in requirements but imports it in the setup.py before installation. Should be fixed.
# fasttext==0.9.1 installs pybind11==2.9.1. If install pybind11==2.2.4 after that two times, second installation will raise error Cannot uninstall pybind11 2.9.1, RECORD file not found.
hdt==2.3
