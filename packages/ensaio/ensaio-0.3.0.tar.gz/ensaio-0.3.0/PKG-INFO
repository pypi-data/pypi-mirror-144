About
-----

**Ensaio** (Portuguese for "rehearsal") is a Python package for downloading
open-access sample datasets for Geoscience.
It taps into the `Fatiando a Terra FAIR data collection
<https://github.com/fatiando-data>`__ that is designed for use in tutorials,
documentation, and teaching.

It uses `Pooch <https://www.fatiando.org/pooch>`__ to manage downloading and
caching the data on your computer.
This means that datasets are only downloaded if they can't be found on your
computer already.

Project goals
-------------

* Provide minimal code for downloading our sample data (basically just creates
  the relevant Pooch code).
* Only download and let the user load the data. This helps make tutorials and
  examples more easily extended to a user's own data.
* Be fully backwards compatible. We achieve this by separating **data**
  versions from **Ensaio** versions. Data fetching functions allow you to
  choose any data version that is older than the version of Ensaio that's
  installed. Major releases of Ensaio will be few and far between (if any).
