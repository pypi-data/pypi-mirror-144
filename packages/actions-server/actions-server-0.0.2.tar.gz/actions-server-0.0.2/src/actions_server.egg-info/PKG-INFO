# Actions Server

A very simple, multi-threaded HTTP server.

Mainly designed for a very simple tasks, f.ex. 3 json-based endpoints with a simple logic

It utilizes a concept of "Actions" - the functions that can be executed to provide HTTP response.

## Important note:

This server DOES NOT cover all HTTP functionality.
This is intentional and probably will not be changed in the future.
