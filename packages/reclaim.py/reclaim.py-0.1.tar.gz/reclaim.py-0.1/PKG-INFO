    2) Search for "Google Tasks API" or go [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/tasks.googleapis.com?q=search&referrer=search) and click the blue "Activate" button
    3) Once activated, click "Manage" (also blue button)
    4) Naviagte to "OAuth consent screen"
    5) Create an "external" Consent Screen and fill out the <u>required</u> fields (Email fields: Put your Gmail there, Name fields: put in anything)

<br>

    10) Naviage to "Credentials" and click "Create Credentials", "OAuth Client ID". Then select "Desktop app" as type.
    11) Once created, click "Download Json" on the popup shown. Save this file as `credentials.json` in your project folder.
   <br><br>
1. With the `credentials.json` in the same folder as your application, you can start creating some tasks:

```py
import reclaim
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

client = reclaim.Client(credentials = "credentails.json", token_store = "token.json")
                        # you can optionally set reclaim_task_list_id if you don't want it to be detected automatically


if not client.authorized: # authorize your google account once
    client.do_authorization() # You will be asked to Login with Google. Just follow the instructions printed.

assert client.authorized # ensure you are authorized with Google

succeeded:bool = client.create_task(is_work = True,
                    title = "My fancy Reclaim task",
                    duration = timedelta(hours = 2, minutes = 30), # 2 hours, 30 minutes
                    due_at = datetime.now() + timedelta(weeks = 3),
                    not_before = datetime.now() + timedelta(days = 4), # only start in 4 days            
                )
print(succeeded) # should output True
```
