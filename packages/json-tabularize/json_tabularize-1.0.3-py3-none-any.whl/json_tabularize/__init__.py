'''
An unusually powerful algorithm for converting JSON into a tabular format, which is defined as an array of flat (all scalar values) objects.

Every algorithm I've seen for making JSON into a table can't fully normalize very deeply nested JSON, but instead produces partially normalized JSON where some rows in the resultant table just have raw un-normalized JSON.
