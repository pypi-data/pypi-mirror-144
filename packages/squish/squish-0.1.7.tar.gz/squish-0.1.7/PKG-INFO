Squish: Soft Packing Simulations
================================

**Squish** is a Python library that handles simulations for the flow of 'soft' or 'compressible' objects,
under some energy in a *periodic* domain. The gradient flow of the objects are simulated and is able to be saved and rendered into diagrams. **Squish** also provides simple to use scripts for basic usage, as well as a simple API for more advanced functionality.

Fast parallelized Cython code is used to compute the simulations efficienctly. Also, `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_ arrays are used, enabling easy integratation with the standard scientific Python ecosystem.
