# Deep Draken

Deep Draken aims to provide a framework for developing Deep Learning Models in Image Domain. It currently supports Pytorch and have implementations for image generation algorithems like:
* GAN
* CGAN
* WGAN
* WGANGP

# Installation

**1. Basic Installation**

You can install DeepDraken's latest release by using [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip).
The command is as follows:
