    blacks : length-5 list of lists
        A list of lowercase letters that are not in the word.  For example, if our

        `blacks = [[], ['A'], [], [], []]`.
    yellows : length-5 list of lists

        not the third letter, `yellows = [[], [], ['a'], [], []]`.
    greens : length-5 list

        the letter must appear in the solution, and defaults to one.
        For example, if a previous guess was 'array' with the two 'r's colored, then we
        would know the solution must have at least two 'r's and so `counts = {'r': 2}`.
        If a previous guess was 'array', with one 'r' marked black and one colored, then
