# Description =================================================================
# This script is to simulate the movement of clouds
# Assumption:
# 1. The rain and snow happens only when there are clouds above
# 2. Wind speed is not related to the movement of clouds, in both speed and direction
# 3. Spinning of clouds are not modeled

# Reference ===================================================================
# Taylor's Hypothesis ---------------------------------------------------------
#     A series of changes in time at a fixed place is due to the passage of an unchanging 
#     spatial pattern over that locale. That is, when observing a cloud or thunderstorm 
#     passing overhead, the clouds of the thunderstorm floating by are effectively 
#     "unchanging spatial patterns" (big blocks of cloud). Put another way, the lateral 
#     change in the cloud conditions across regions of the meteorological event (e.g., 
#     cloud-sky-cloud-sky-cloud) can be directly connected locally with a variation in 
#     irradiance measurement over time (e.g., a periodic measure of dark-bright-dark-bright-dark).
