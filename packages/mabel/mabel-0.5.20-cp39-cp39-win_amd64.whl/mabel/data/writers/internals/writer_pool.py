"""
The WriterPool maintains multiple BlobWriters.

It allows new ParitionWriters be be added to the pool, and when the size of the
pool exceeds the stated size limit, it can recommend the least recently used
BlobWriters to be evicted. Note the pool_size is not a hard limit, there
can be more active BlobWriters, this is used to determine how many
BlobWriters to recommend for evict.
