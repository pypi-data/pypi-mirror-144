## Configuring access to Databricks

In order to use Tentaclio to connect to a Databricks cluster or SQL endpoint, it is necessary to install the required
[ODBC driver](https://databricks.com/spark/odbc-drivers-download) for your operating system.

Once installed, it is possible to access Databricks as you would any supported URL protocol. However,
it is likely that you will have to pass some [additional variables](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi.html)
in the URL query string, including the path to the installed driver.

For example, if your Databricks connection requires you to set DRIVER and HTTPPATH values,
the URL should look like this:

```
databricks+pyodbc://<token>@<host>/<database>?DRIVER=<path/to/driver>&HTTPPath=<http_path>
```
