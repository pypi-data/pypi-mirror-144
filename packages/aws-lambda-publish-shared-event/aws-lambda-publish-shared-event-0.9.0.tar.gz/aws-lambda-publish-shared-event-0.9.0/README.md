- Publish 100 different examples (`publish-shared-event -e ses/ses.json ...`)
- Publish multiple events with the same schema structure for a single lambda
- Set test name or use the test event file name (`publish-shared-event -n custom-name ...`)
- Get the list of built-in test events (`publish-shared-event --list`)

## Usage

Once installed run `publish-shared-event --help` for the list of commands.

```

Publishing a `ses/ses.json` test event as a shareable event for the lambda function named `full-lambda-name`

```script
publish-shared-event -e ses/ses.json -f full-lambda-name -r us-east-1
```

Publishes a locally defined test event `events/yourOwnDefinedEvent.json` to the lambda console

```script
publish-shared-event -e events/yourOwnDefinedEvent.json -f your-function -r us-west-2
```

Publish two different tests with custom names.

> **NOTE:** Both tests must share the same schema

```script
publish-shared-event -n createCustomerPass -e eventOne.json -f full-lambda-name -r us-east-1
publish-shared-event -n createCustomerFailure -e eventTwo.json -f full-lambda-name -r us-east-1
```

Using the interactive cli tool:

```
publish-shared-event
Lambda Name: <Full Lambda Name>
Select Event:
* alb/alb.json
    alexa/alex-smart-home-skill-v1.json
    alexa/alex-smart-home-skill-v3.json
