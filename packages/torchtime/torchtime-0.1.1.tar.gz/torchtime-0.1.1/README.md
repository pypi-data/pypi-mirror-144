`torchtime` provides ready-to-go time series data sets for use in PyTorch. The current list of supported data sets is:

* All data sets in the UEA/UCR classification repository [[link]](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/)
* PhysioNet Challenge 2019 (early prediction of sepsis) [[link]](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/)

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install torchtime
```

## Using `torchtime`

The example below uses the `torchtime.data.UEA` class. The data set is specified using the `dataset` argument (see list of data sets [here](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/dataset.php)). The `split` argument determines whether training, validation or test data are returned. The size of the splits are controlled with the `train_split` and `val_split` arguments. Reproducibility is achieved using the `seed` argument.

For example, to load training data for the [ArrowHead](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ArrowHead) data set with a 70/30% training/validation split:

```
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchtime.data import UEA

arrowhead = UEA(
    dataset="ArrowHead",
    split="train",
    train_split=0.7,
    seed=456789,
)
dataloader = DataLoader(arrowhead, batch_size=32)
```

The DataLoader returns batches as a dictionary of tensors `X`, `y` and `length`. `X` are the time series data. By default, a time stamp is appended to the data as the first channel. This package follows the *batch first* convention therefore `X` has shape (*n*, *s*, *c*) where *n* is batch size, *s* is trajectory length and *c* is the number of channels.

ArrowHead is a univariate time series with 251 observations in each trajectory. `X` therefore has two channels, the time stamp followed by the time series.

```
>> next(iter(dataloader))["X"]

tensor([[[  0.0000,  -1.8302],
         [  1.0000,  -1.8123],
         [  2.0000,  -1.8122],
         ...,
         [248.0000,  -1.7821],
         [249.0000,  -1.7971],
         [250.0000,  -1.8280]],

        ...,

        [[  0.0000,  -1.8392],
         [  1.0000,  -1.8314],
         [  2.0000,  -1.8125],
         ...,
         [248.0000,  -1.8359],
         [249.0000,  -1.8202],
         [250.0000,  -1.8387]]])
```

Labels `y` are one-hot encoded and have shape (*n*, *l*) where *l* is the number of classes.

```
>> next(iter(dataloader))["y"]

tensor([[0, 0, 1],
        [1, 0, 0],
        [1, 0, 0],

        ...,

        [0, 0, 1],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [1, 0, 0]])

```

The `length` of each trajectory (before padding if the data set is of irregular length) is provided as a tensor of shape (*n*).

```
>> next(iter(dataloader))["length"]

tensor([251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251,
        251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251, 251,
        251, 251, 251, 251])
```

Missing data can be simulated using the `missing` argument. In addition, missing data/observational masks and time delta channels can be appended using the `mask` and `delta` arguments. See the [tutorial](https://philipdarke.com/torchtime/tutorial.html) and [API](https://philipdarke.com/torchtime/api.html) for more information.
