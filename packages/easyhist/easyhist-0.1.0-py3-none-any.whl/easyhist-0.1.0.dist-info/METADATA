# Easy Histogram
This is a very small python package used to make histograms in python, and optionally plot them with `matplotlib`. The underlying histogramming tool is from `numpy`. This provides a very handy wrappers around them to easily make common histograms in 1d and 2d and plot with nice labels.

# Installation

```bash
$ pip install easyhist
```


# Usage

You can import the library and make histograms and plot them(optionally)


```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import easyhist as eh


# initialize data
x = np.random.normal(0,1,10000)


# make histogram
h = eh.Hist1D(x,bins='auto')


# This hist object contains histogram. If you want to plot it
fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(12,6))

h.plot(ax)

# h.plot(ax) will plot the histogram on the matplotlib axis.

```
