2021.04.24 v0.0.17 Fix various issues, add --url and mlbv-fzf
- Add 'mlbv-fzf' wrapper script
    - provides a simple game selection text-based user interface
    - accepts relevant mlbv options for day/inning/record selection
    - only works for the default, one-line game list (not for --linescore/--boxscore, etc)
    - requires 'fzf' installed
- Issue 42: mlbv now returns exit code from streamlink
    - use this to check for failures

2019.07.28 v0.0.12 Fixed mlbv
Fixed inning offset for both live and archived games
- Fixes Issue #7
    - If you have 'stream_start_offset_secs' set in your config file you may want to reset it to 0 now,
      since the inning times should now be calculated correctly. Alternatively, set it to something 
      like 10 if you want to come in a little early
