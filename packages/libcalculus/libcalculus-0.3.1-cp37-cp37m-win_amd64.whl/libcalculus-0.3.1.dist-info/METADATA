# libcalculus: A comprehensive real and complex analysis library for Python

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/ariter777/libcalculus/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/ariter777/libcalculus/commits/master)

libcalculus is fully written in C++ and Cython for bindings to Python; all numeric calculations take place in C++ and take full advantage of SIMD vectorization and OpenMP threading wherever available.

## Features

- Functional programming approach to analysis in Python
- Numeric integration and differentiation of real and complex functions
- Full integration with NumPy: functions support array inputs
- LaTeX support: every function object has a `.latex()` that produces its LaTeX markup

## Technology
libcalculus is written in C\+\+20 and bound to Python via Cython; operations between functions are performed using C++ lambdas, and all calculations happen at the C++ level, with Python only interfacing methods and results.

## Installation
libcalculus can be installed from pip:
```
pip install libcalculus
```

## Examples
Here is a snippet demonstrating some of the library's features:
```python
>>> import libcalculus, numpy as np
>>> f = libcalculus.identity ** 2 * (libcalculus.sin @ (3 / libcalculus.identity)) # represents z^2 * sin(3/z)
>>> f(1 + 2j)
(1.9161297498044316+7.826928799856612j)
>>> libcalculus.residue(f, 0, tol=1e-4) # residue of f around z=0, with an error tolerance of 1e-4
(-4.499999999971643+1.3805827092608378e-05j)
>>> print(f.latex("t"))
{t}^{2}\sin\left( \frac{3}{t}\right)
>>> contour = libcalculus.exp @ (1j * libcalculus.identity) # represents the contour e^(i*t)
>>> libcalculus.integrate(f, contour, 1, 2) # integrate along the contour between t=1 and t=2
(-0.0607129128779003-8.877187778245547j)
>>> libcalculus.threads(4) # Enable threading
>>> arr = np.array([[1, 2j, 3], [4 + 1j, 5 + 2j, 7 + 3j]])
>>> f(arr)
array([[1.41120008e-01+0.j        , 1.04304611e-15+8.51711782j,
        7.57323886e+00+0.j        ],
       [1.09624856e+01+3.24567376j, 1.42295657e+01+6.29864507j,
        2.04585023e+01+9.22847707j]])
```
