# FlaskDrop

A small http file drop server.

# Why?

I was looking for a easy way to transfer files from my phone to a computer and found dozens of similar prjects but non has fit my needs.

# How

```
# Install flaskdrop
pip install flaskdrop

# cd into the folder where you want the files to be dropped
cd /home/me/upload

# start flaskdrop
python -m flaskdrop

# You shoud see the debug output of the flask dev server that tells you which IP:port you need to access from you mobile phones browser
# Something like Running on http://192.168.33.148:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
